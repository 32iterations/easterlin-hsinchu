## Executive Summary

Virtual Reality (VR) rehabilitation has emerged as a validated non-pharmacological intervention for elderly care, with the global market projected to grow from $174M (2024) to $371M (2030) at 13.45% CAGR. Recent meta-analyses (2024-2025) demonstrate small-to-medium effect sizes (ES = 0.29-0.42) for cognitive and physical outcomes in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia.

**Key Findings:**
- **Clinical Efficacy**: VR significantly improves global cognition (MoCA scores: MD = 2.34), attention, balance, and gait in elderly populations
- **Optimal Protocol**: 30-60 minutes, 2-3x/week for 5-8 weeks yields best outcomes
- **Technology Preference**: Semi-immersive VR (e.g., Meta Quest 3) shows better safety/efficacy than fully-immersive systems
- **Cost Range**: $500-50,000 depending on system complexity; consumer headsets ($500-1,000) + software subscriptions ($200-500/month) offer best value
- **ROI**: 35% increase in billing efficiency reported; reduces fall risk by 30-40% in validated studies
- **Implementation Barriers**: Staff training (60+ hours), infrastructure costs, and organizational resistance remain challenges

**Recommendation for 赤土崎**: Implement hybrid VR program using Meta Quest 3 headsets ($500 each) + specialized elderly care software (Rendever/XR Salud Senior) for cognitive training, balance therapy, and social engagement. Estimated setup: 4 headsets = $2,000 + annual subscription $6,000-12,000 = $8,000-14,000 Year 1.
